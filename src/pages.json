[{"content":"## About Me\n\n\nHi 👋 I'm **kyu**, and I'm a software engineer.\n\n\n\nI was born in 1997 (you can do the math), in South Korea.\nI'm definitely not a hard working type so do check on my github😆. \n\n\n\n\nHere is the list of things that I do in a day.\n* Commit **1** work on github👨🏻‍💻\n* Drink **2** cups of coffee☕️\n* Plan **4** times on what to have for dinner 🍔\n* Watch **8** videos from YouTube  🎬\n* For **16** times I try, not to try to think of myself, as a person who’s not trying to think, but that already makes me a person who is thinking at the moment, which makes me think if I should loop again. 🤔\n\n\n\n**Bless you!!**\n"}]
