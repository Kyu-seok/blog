## About Me


Hi 👋 I'm **kyu**, and I'm a software engineer.



I was born in 1997 (you can do the math), in South Korea.
I'm definitely not a hard working type so do check on my github😆. 




Here is the list of things that I do in a day.
* Commit **1** work on github👨🏻‍💻
* Drink **2** cups of coffee☕️
* Plan **4** times on what to have for dinner 🍔
* Watch **8** videos from YouTube  🎬
* For **16** times I try, not to try to think of myself, as a person who’s not trying to think, but that already makes me a person who is thinking at the moment, which makes me think if I should loop again. 🤔



**Bless you!!**
